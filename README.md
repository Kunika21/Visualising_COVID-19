# Visualising COVID-19 Dataset

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. To understand the pattern of its outbreak accross countries, visualisations can help. This repository contains few such visuals which exihibits the trends among recovered, confirmed and death cases. The dataset can be obtained from [here](https://bit.ly/2FWr56j)

COVID-19 Metadata: The tabular datasets published by the World
Health Organization to create new networks (similarity networks, correla-
tion networks, etc.) and visualize network communities.
• The data is in tabular format and is contained inside multiple csv files in
multiple formats.
• One of the formats is the time-series format in which the number of
cases(deaths, recovered, and confirmed) are being recorded day-wise and
stored in accordance with there positions in world coordinates.
• The time-series data for United states particularly is also available.
• The data has been recorded from 22nd January, 2020 to 23rd Septem-
ber,2020.
• Three categories of cases are recorded in three separate files viz.
– time series covid 19 deaths.csv,
– time series covid 19 recovered.csv, and
– time series covid 19 confirmed.csv.
